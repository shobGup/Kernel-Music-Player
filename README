Assignment:
~~~~~~~~~~~

    - Add support for reading ext2 file systems
    - Donate a test case

Warnings:
~~~~~~~~~

(1) The code I'm sharing with you doesn't synchronize access. This makes
    it non thread safe. It is your responsibility to identify critical
    sections and control access to them.

(2) File system data structures live on disks which are slow. You might
    be tempted to cache data in memory which is what any reasonable
    implementation would do. Do that with care and beware of potential
    inconsistencies (e.g. one thread reading from a cached copy and another
    reading the same data directly from disk)

The file system API:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    

Four classes work together in order to implement the file system support:

    - BlockIO (in block_io.h): a base class implemented by all block
      oriented parts of the system (Disks, Nodes, ...). You need to
      publicly inherit from BlockIO and implement 2 methods in order
      to support the BlockIO interface. Look in block_io.h and
      block_io.cc for more information.

    - Ide (in ide.h/ide.cc): simple IDE device driver. Gives you access
      to disks. Our file systems will always reside in IDE device#1.

    - Ext2 (in ext2.h and ext2.cc): defines the interface to the
      file system. The interface is defined for you but you need
      to implement it.

    - Node (in ext2.h and ext2.cc): defines the interface to a node
      in the file system hierarchy (i-node). The interface is defined
      for you but you need to provide the implementation.

    Both Ide and Node implement the BlockIO interface.

    All 4 classes are required to have an embedded ref_count for ARC

    Look in the header files for API details.

The ext2 subset:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We will only implement directories, files, and symbolic links. We will
limit our file system image size to 10MB and the total size of the files
in your test image to 100KB.

Hard links come naturally with Unix-style file systems but our ability
to test them will be limited because of GIT limitations.

Defining a test case:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Test cases will be more involved because they require the
preparation of a disk image. The Makefile automates a good part
of the work but you need to do a little more work as well.

You need to do 4 things in order to add a test case

(1) add a <csid>.cc test driver as in previous assignments

(2) add a <csid>.ok file with the expected output as in previous assignments

(3) add a text file named <csid>.block_size with a single number in it.
    It specifies the required file system block size. Acceptable values
    are:

        1024, 2048, and 4196

    All other values will result in undefined behavior

(4) add a directory named <csid>.dir and fill it with the files and
    directories you want to copy to your disk image. Please limit its
    total size to 100K. The Makefile will populate the disk image
    with the contents of this directory before running the test.        

Model your test after the given tests (t0, t1, and t2)

Browsing disk images:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Disk images are binary files, you can use a tool like hexdump
to browse their contents.

Disk images will reside in <test>.data

To make a disk image: "make <test>.data"
To examine it: "hexdump <test>.data"

For Makefile help:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    make help

To run tests:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    make clean test

To make the output less noisy:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    make -s clean test

Server view targets:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    make get_results    # gets and displays your results
    make get_tests      # gets tests from the server
    make get_summary    # shows results per test

To run one test
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    make -s t0.test               # run the test once
    make -s t0.loop               # run the test 10 times
    LOOP_LIMIT=6 make -s t0.loop  # run the test 6 times
    make -s t0.fail               # run the test until it fails

To run by hand
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    ./run_qemu t0

To run with gdb
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    ./debug_qemu t0

       Then follow the instructions on the screen

Generated files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For each test, a set of files will be generated:

    <test>.raw          the raw output from running QEMU
    <test>.time         how long it took to run the test
    <test>.failure      failure information in case of failure
    <test>.out          the lines that start with *** from the raw output
    <test>.diff         the difference between <test>.out and <test>.ok
    <test>.result       pass or fail
    <test>.data         the ext2 disk image
